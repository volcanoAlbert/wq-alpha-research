# WQ Alpha Research Skill

A self-evolving WorldQuant BRAIN alpha research skill. It helps agents design WQ Alpha expressions, search fields, diagnose simulation failures, check IS metrics, manage self-correlation, and turn each BRAIN interaction into reusable research rules.

The core idea is simple: do not let alpha research stay as scattered one-off prompts. Use the skill to build alphas, test them, inspect failures, compare daily-return correlations, and then distill the useful lessons back into `SKILL.md`.

This repository is a reusable agent skill, not a credential bundle. Keep all account credentials, raw alpha IDs, PnL records, and private candidate expressions local.

## Why This Skill Exists

WQ Alpha mining is not only about writing more expressions. The bottleneck is usually the research loop:

- finding usable fields fast enough;
- avoiding repeated low-Sharpe templates;
- controlling turnover before submission;
- checking SELF_CORRELATION against existing ACTIVE alphas;
- preserving lessons from failed simulations instead of rediscovering them later.

This skill packages that loop into an agent-readable playbook plus scripts. It gives the agent local field context, practical expression templates, IS failure diagnostics, submission checks, and a self-evolution mechanism for turning new runs into better future behavior.

## Mining Effect

The current playbook is built around USA TOP3000 delay=1 and includes a local snapshot of 4,367 BRAIN data fields. It has already distilled several practical mining rules:

- Fundamental fields are usually the strongest starting point; `group_rank + ts_rank` with `SUBINDUSTRY` neutralization is the default baseline.
- Analyst expectation fields are useful but need more turnover control, usually via modest decay and industry/subindustry neutralization.
- Pure technical signals fail more often unless decay is high or they are mixed with slower fundamental signals.
- Fitness failures are often turnover problems in disguise; decay and signal mixing are the first levers to check.
- Self-correlation must be measured on daily PnL changes, not cumulative PnL curves.
- Changing windows, weights, or neutralization rarely creates truly low-correlation alphas by itself; low correlation usually needs a different data source or economic logic.

The goal is not to promise a fixed Sharpe or submission pass rate. The value is a faster, cleaner alpha mining loop: fewer invalid-field attempts, less repeated correlation failure, better default templates, and a growing memory of what worked or failed.

## Self-Evolution Loop

`scripts/evolve_skill.py` is the feedback engine. After simulations, submissions, or status checks, it can fetch the user's alpha list, compare new/changed alphas with the local snapshot, compute daily-return correlations against ACTIVE alphas, and generate a Markdown lesson snippet.

Recommended loop:

1. Generate or modify candidate expressions from `SKILL.md`.
2. Simulate and inspect IS checks on BRAIN.
3. Pull all ACTIVE alphas and compare daily-return correlation.
4. Run `python scripts/evolve_skill.py` to preview new lessons.
5. Review the output manually.
6. Run `python scripts/evolve_skill.py --apply` only for local/private updates.
7. Publish only sanitized general rules, never raw account-linked records.

## What It Helps With

- Search USA TOP3000 delay=1 BRAIN fields locally.
- Build Alpha expressions from common WQ operator patterns.
- Diagnose low Sharpe, low Fitness, high Turnover, concentrated weights, and sub-universe failures.
- Compare candidate alphas against existing ACTIVE alphas using daily-return correlation.
- Automate simulation/submission workflows with explicit post-submit status checks.
- Evolve the skill from local alpha research notes without committing private records.

## Quick Start

Read `SKILL.md` first. It contains the actual playbook and trigger instructions.

For local field lookup:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

fields = json.loads(
    Path("references/wq_usa_top3000_delay1_data_fields.json").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
)

keyword = "operating_income"
matches = [
    f for f in fields
    if keyword in f["id"].lower()
    or keyword in (f.get("description") or "").lower()
]
print(matches[:5])
```

## BRAIN Credentials

Use environment variables:

```bash
export WQ_BRAIN_USERNAME="your_username"
export WQ_BRAIN_PASSWORD="your_password"
```

Or create a local `credential.txt` file:

```json
["your_username", "your_password"]
```

`credential.txt` is ignored by git. Do not commit real credentials, cookies, sessions, tokens, alpha databases, or submission results.

## Scripts

Preview skill evolution output without modifying files:

```bash
python scripts/evolve_skill.py
```

Apply updates to local `SKILL.md` and `alpha_db.json` after reviewing the preview:

```bash
python scripts/evolve_skill.py --apply
```

Run the batch submission example:

```bash
python scripts/submit_batch.py
```

The scripts require `requests` and `numpy`. `alpha_db.json` is a local memory file and is intentionally ignored by git.

## Safety Notes

The following files are intentionally ignored:

- `credential.txt`
- `alpha_db.json`
- `batch_submit_results.json`
- `.env`
- Python caches and virtual environments

If you want to publish research lessons from local runs, summarize them into general rules before adding them to `SKILL.md`. Do not publish raw alpha IDs, PnL series, account-linked submission statuses, or private candidate expressions.
